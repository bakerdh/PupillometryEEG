@article{Wang2015,
	abstract = {Pupil size, as a component of orienting, changes rapidly in response to local salient events in the environment, in addition to its well-known illumination-dependent modulation. Recent research has shown that visual, auditory, or audiovisual stimuli can elicit transient pupil dilation, and the timing and size of the evoked responses are systematically modulated by stimulus salience. Moreover, weak microstimulation of the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure involved in eye movements and attention, evokes similar transient pupil dilation, suggesting that the SC coordinates the orienting response which includes transient pupil dilation. Projections from the SC to the pupil control circuitry provide a novel neural substrate underlying pupil modulation by various cognitive processes. },

@article{Meese2006,
	abstract = {A fundamental problem for any visual system with binocular overlap is the combination of information from the two eyes. Electrophysiology shows that binocular integration of luminance contrast occurs early in visual cortex, but a specific systems architecture has not been established for human vision. Here, we address this by performing binocular summation and monocular, binocular, and dichoptic masking experiments for horizontal 1 cycle per degree test and masking gratings. These data reject three previously published proposals, each of which predict too little binocular summation and insufficient dichoptic facilitation. However, a simple development of one of the rejected models (the twin summation model) and a completely new model (the two-stage model) provide very good fits to the data. Two features common to both models are gently accelerating (almost linear) contrast transduction prior to binocular summation and suppressive ocular interactions that contribute to contrast gain control. With all model parameters fixed, both models correctly predict (1) systematic variation in psychometric slopes, (2) dichoptic contrast matching, and (3) high levels of binocular summation for various levels of binocular pedestal contrast. A review of evidence from elsewhere leads us to favor the two-stage model.},

@article{McDougal2010,
	abstract = {Historically, it was assumed that the light-evoked neural signals driving the human pupillary light reflex (PLR) originated exclusively from rod and cone photoreceptors. However, a novel melanopsin-containing photoreceptive cell class has recently been discovered in the mammalian retina. These intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) project to the pretectum, the retinorecipient area of the brain responsible for the PLR. This study was therefore designed to examine the relative contribution of rod, cone and the melanopsin photoresponses of ipRGCs to the human PLR. We establish that the melanopsin photoresponse of ipRGCs contributes significantly to the maintenance of half maximal pupilloconstriction in response to light stimuli of 30s or longer, even at low photopic irradiances. Furthermore, we show that the melanopsin photoresponse contributes significantly to three-quarter maximal pupilloconstriction in response to light stimuli as short as 2s. We also demonstrate that cone photoresponses driving pupilloconstriction adapt considerably and contribute little after 30s, but rod photoresponses adapt less and contribute significantly to the maintenance of pupilloconstriction in response to steady-state light stimuli at irradiance levels which are below the threshold of the melanopsin photoresponse.},

@article{Mathot2018,
	abstract = {Pupils respond to three distinct kinds of stimuli: they constrict in response to brightness (the pupil light response), constrict in response to near fixation (the pupil near response), and dilate in response to increases in arousal and mental effort, either triggered by an external stimulus or spontaneously. In this review, I describe these three pupil responses, how they are related to high-level cognition, and the neural pathways that control them. I also discuss the functional relevance of pupil responses, that is, how pupil responses help us to better see the world. Although pupil responses likely serve many functions, not all of which are fully understood, one important function is to optimize vision either for acuity (small pupils see sharper) and depth of field (small pupils see sharply at a wider range of distances), or for sensitivity (large pupils are better able to detect faint stimuli); that is, pupils change their size to optimize vision for a particular situation. In many ways, pupil responses are similar to other eye movements, such as saccades and smooth pursuit: like these other eye movements, pupil responses have properties of both reflexive and voluntary action, and are part of active visual exploration.},

Quadratic summation is applied to the results of experiments in which stimuli presented to the two eyes differ only in contrast. It provides a good, first-order account of binocular summation in contrast detection, contrast discrimination, dichoptic masking, contrast matching and reaction time studies.

@article{Ding2006,
	abstract = {In binocular combination, light images on the two retinas are combined to form a single "cyclopean" perceptual image, in contrast to binocular rivalry which occurs when the two eyes have incompatible ("rivalrous") inputs and only one eye;s stimulus is perceived. We propose a computational theory for binocular combination with two basic principles of interaction: in every spatial neighborhood, each eye (i) exerts gain control on the other eye's signal in proportion to the contrast energy of its own input and (ii) additionally exerts gain control on the other eye's gain control. For stimuli of ordinary contrast, when either eye is stimulated alone, the predicted cyclopean image is the same as when both eyes are stimulated equally, coinciding with an easily observed property of natural vision. The gain-control theory is contrast dependent: Very low-contrast stimuli to the left- and right-eye add linearly to form the predicted cyclopean image. The intrinsic nonlinearity manifests itself only as contrast increases. To test the theory more precisely, a horizontal sine wave grating of 0.68 cycles per degree is presented to each eye. The gratings differ in contrast and phase. The predicted (and perceived) cyclopean grating also is a sine wave; its apparent phase indicates the relative contribution of the two eyes to the cyclopean image. For 48 measured combinations of phase and contrast, the theory with only one estimated parameter accounts for 95% of the variance of the data. Therefore, a simple, robust, physiologically plausible gain-control theory accurately describes an early stage of binocular combination.},

@article{Delorme2004,
	abstract = {We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running under the crossplatform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any number of channels. Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.},

@article{Baker2018,
	abstract = {Our ability to detect faint images is better with two eyes than with one, but how great is this improvement? A meta-analysis of 65 studies published across more than 5 decades shows definitively that psychophysical binocular summation (the ratio of binocular to monocular contrast sensitivity) is significantly greater than the canonical value of √2. Several methodological factors were also found to affect summation estimates. Binocular summation was significantly affected by both the spatial and temporal frequency of the stimulus, and stimulus speed (the ratio of temporal to spatial frequency) systematically predicts summation levels, with slow speeds (high spatial and low temporal frequencies) producing the strongest summation. We furthermore show that empirical summation estimates are affected by the ratio of monocular sensitivities, which varies across individuals, and is abnormal in visual disorders such as amblyopia. A simple modeling framework is presented to interpret the results of summation experiments. In combination with the empirical results, this model suggests that there is no single value for binocular summation, but instead that summation ratios depend on methodological factors that influence the strength of a nonlinearity occurring early in the visual pathway, before binocular combination of signals. Best practice methodological guidelines are proposed for obtaining accurate estimates of neural summation in future studies, including those involving patient groups with impaired binocular vision.

@article{Anstis1998,
	abstract = {The changes in apparent brightness or color, induced into a test spot by a surround, can be greatly enhanced either by flickering the test spot between two luminances, or by binocularly fusing a pair of test spots of different luminances. Simultaneous contrast, in which a white surround makes a grey spot look darker, is greatly enhanced if the spot (not the surround) flickers between black and white. Colour contrast is likewise enhanced by chromatic flicker: on a blue surround, a grey spot looks slightly yellowish, but a yellow/blue flickering spot looks strongly yellow. Temporal successive contrasts, or negative afterimages, are also enhanced by flickering the test field. The negative afterimage of a half-white, half-black rectangle looked dark grey and light grey when projected on a grey test field, but it looked almost black and almost white when projected on a test field that flickered between black and white. Coloured negative afterimages were also enhanced by projecting them on a chromatic flickering test field. We examined the combination rules for pairs of luminances which were presented either successively as flicker or else dichoptically (and fused binocularly). The brightness averaging functions for spatial increments (light spots) on dark surrounds were quasi-linear for binocular fusion but quadratic for flicker. For spatial decrements (dark spots) on white surrounds, the brightness averaging functions were strongly nonlinear winner-take-all for both binocular fusion and flicker. We also found temporal analogues of Fechner's [(1860). Elements of psychophysics. New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston, 1966] paradox and Levelt's [(1965). British Journal of Psychology, 56, 1-13] dichoptic contour effect. We conclude that the visual rules for combining luminance excursions, whether in flicker or binocular fusion, favour disproportionately the spot with the higher contrast.},

@article{Angee2021,
	abstract = {Iris integrity is required to regulate both the amount of light reaching the retina and intraocular pressure (IOP), with elevated IOP being a major risk factor for glaucoma. Congenital microcoria (MCOR) is an extremely rare, autosomal dominant disease affecting iris development and hindering both of these functions. It is characterized by absent or underdeveloped dilator muscle fibers and immaturity of the iridocorneal angle-where the aqueous humor is drained-which play a central role in IOP regulation. The dilator muscle anomaly is manifested in pinhole pupils (<2 mm) and thin transilluminable irises, causing both hemeralopia and photoaversion. Axial myopia and juvenile open-angle glaucoma are very frequent (80% and 30% of all cases, respectively). It has been suggested that the immaturity of the chamber angle contributes to glaucoma, and myopia has been ascribed to photoaversion and elevated IOP. Though possible, these mechanisms are insufficient. The disease has been tied to chromosome 13q32.1 structural variations. In addition to compromising iris development, modification of the 13q32.1 architecture could alter signaling pathways for axial ocular length and IOP regulation. Here, we summarize the clinical, histological, and molecular features of this disease, and we discuss the possible etiology of associated anomalies.},

@article{Anderson1989,
	abstract = {We studied the detectability of dichoptically presented vertical grating patterns that varied in the ratio of the contrasts presented to the two eyes. The resulting threshold data fall on a binocular summation contour well described by a power summation equation with an exponent near 2. We studied the effect of adding one-dimensional visual noise, either correlated or uncorrelated between the eyes, to the grating patterns. The addition of uncorrelated noise elevated thresholds uniformly for all interocular ratios, while correlated noise elevated thresholds for stimuli whose ratios were near 1 more than thresholds for other stimuli. We also examined the effects of monocular adaptation to a high-contrast grating on the form of the summation contour. Such adaptation elevates threshold in a manner that varies continuously with the interocular contrast ratio of the test targets, and increases the amount of binocular summation. Each of several current models can explain some of our results, but no one of them seems capable of accounting for all three sets of data. We therefore develop a new multiple-channel model, the distribution model, which postulates a family of linear binocular channels that vary in their sensitivities to the two monocular inputs. This model can account for our data and those of others concerning binocular summation, masking, adaptation and interocular transfer. We conclude that there exists a system of ocular dominance channels in the human visual system.},
